# Student-Report-Automation
We have created an automated report generator, which generates and sends monthly report of each individual in a pdf format  at the end of the month. The project was divided into three parts:-
- Analysing phase - It analyses each student's data month wise
- Pdf generation - Uses the data from the analysing phase and generates a pdf for each student.
- Email sender - Sends the report to the concerned student via mail.
